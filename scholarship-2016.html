      .... "My sophomore year of high school, I was introduced to
      <a href="https://www.mhanational.org/sites/default/files/MHA_CAM.pdf" target="_blank">mental illness</a>.
      My friend opened up to me about her struggle with depression. She explained how hard it is for her to
      go about her day without feeling lonely. I asked if she's thought about receiving help. From her reaction,
      I realized how big of an issue the stigma of mental illness is.....
      <br>
      I have decided to go into a helping profession because I feel strongly about mental illness and want to help
      those struggling.
      <br>
      Through Forensic Psychology, I will be able to study how mental illness pushes people to the break. I want to
      help spread awareness and properly educate our society so we can end the stigma, helping mental illness
      appear less as a taboo...."
