<h3> Their Stories...</h3>
<br>
<p>
  "I was a victim of bullying when I was 11 yrs old.  Being victimized became an issue for me in 5th grade.
  The hurtful words from my classmates buried me in insecurities and disgust for myself. I developed Generalized
  Anxiety and i constantly worried how people would treat me and think of me.....This was not the way I wanted to
  live for the rest of my life. In 5th grade I was provided with a guidance counselor that changed my life.
  She assured me that my flaws meant nothing for the character inside of me!! Being bullied changed my life
  forever in the most positive way possible. I want to help end the mental health stigma, encourage people to
  seek help even those who are in their teens, to get help"
</p>
<br>
<p>"Suicide & Mental Illness have been a presence in my life for many years. Have experience with depression & OCD
  but most people would never suspect anything at all. Mental Illness strained the relationship I had with
  my parents, who were unable to understand my struggle & looked someone to blame. I also been impacted through
  the experience of others. Have convinced a friend to seek professional help for his suicidality. He has begin
  a path to recovery."</p>
