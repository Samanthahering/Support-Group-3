      ”I am writing to extend my personal thanks for selecting me as one of this year recipients of the
       Joao Jose ‘John’ Santos Memorial Scholarships Awards. The very generous scholarship which your organization
       funded will go a long way to make my college expenses easier to manage.  This organization is very
       inspiring to me and my fellow peers for all that it stands for and in memory of John Santos”  --jk

      ‘I am sincerely honored to have been selected as a recipient of the Joao Jose ‘John’ Santos Memorial
      Scholarship. Each year, the cost of college tuition rises, so I highly value any monetary help I receive.
      Thank you for your generosity which allows me to explode my college opportunities with less burden. Because
      of your scholarship and learning about your organization, I am inspired to continue giving back to the
      community because I know it is appreciated. In fact, I plan to volunteer at the Medical Center or MD
      Cancer Hospital to gain experience in a hospital setting but also to interact with people with different
      past experiences and conditions. Upon receipt of your organization, I am also motivated to continue
      practice compassion and understanding towards all, especially those facing mental health challenges. Thank you
      again for your thoughtful gift. I cherish it deeply and know that it positions me one step closer to
      achieving my goals.  I hope one day I can help students the same way that your organization has helped
      me!”   --cd

      “I cannot thank you enough for selecting me as one of the recipients of the Joao Jose ‘John’ Santos Memorial
      Scholarships.  It is truly an honor to be selected to represent your organization! There is no doubt you
      have a story to share in order to help others in similar situations. As you know, I intend to study
      neuroscience in college in the hopes of researching the effects of concussions on suicide.
      Thank you again for a true honor!!”   --jl
